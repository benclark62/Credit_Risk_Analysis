# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17 Challenge

### Overview
The intent of this exercise was to use multiple machine learning modeling techniques to classify credit applicants as high or low risk.  Given the unbalanced nature of loans - there significantly more safe loans than risky loans - different techniques need to be employed in order to improve the quality of modeling outcomes in order to overcome the heavily skewed training dataset.

Results:

- Naive Random Oversampling
